# microinfo

Using the MEAN stack. I'm aiming for an efficient, scalable platform for contact info sharing.

Working with MongoDB is weird when you need some relations between collections. I've been minimizing joins 
where ever I can, so hopefully even if microinfo encountered heavy traffic, they wont be too taxing, but 
whether or not is currently beyond my knowledge.

More to come!
